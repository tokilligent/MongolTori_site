          <h4>Workshop on Linux</h4>
          <p class="text-justify">The IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS) BRACU SBC hosted a three-day workshop titled "Workshop on Linux" on March 25, 27, and 28, 2021. The workshop's key goal was to educate young minds on the role of Linux in today's technology industry. The organizers hosted this workshop for the Bangladeshi audience and provided it free of charge to all IEEE Student participants. The three-day Linux workshop received much positive feedback. The total number of people who registered for this workshop was about 70, with the bulk of them being IEEE Student members.

Md Hashibul Islam, Chair of IEEE RAS BRACU SBC and Sub-Team Lead of Network and Vision, BRACU Mongol-Tori, led the workshop. Another mentor was Salman Ibne Eunus, a Kaggle Master and Artificial Intelligence Sub-Team Lead at BRACU Mongol-Tori. Both trainers are in their final year of college at BRAC University.

          <h4>Webinar on Fourth Industrial Revolution</h4>
          <p class="text-justify">The IEEE Robotics and Automation Society BRAC University Student Branch Chapter hosted a 4th industrial webinar on "Skills, Approaches, and Mindset necessary for the Fourth Industrial Revolution" on February 5th, 2021. The attendees enjoyed an engaging and insightful session. The cooperation of the crowd inspired the promoters to plan more high-quality activities in the coming days.

Md Mojammel Haque Shourobh (Mechatronics Engineer, Tiger IT Bangladesh LTD) and Mohammed Zahirul Islam (Software Engineer, Embedded Logic Operations and former Team Lead of BRACU Mongol-Tori) were among the speakers on the stand. The speakers generously exchanged their time and experience with the attentive audience. Aside from that, the organizers expressed their gratitude to the honorable advisor, Dr. Khalilur Rhaman (Doctor of Information Engineering, Associate Professor, CSE Department, BRAC University). This event was a success thanks to a strong team effort and the audience's encouragement.

          <h4>Workshop on Robot Operating System (ROS) and Development Boards</h4>
          <p class="text-justify">Razin Bin Issa, Hashib Islam, and Firoz Wadud, three of the brilliant minds behind BRACU Mongol-Tori, designed this workshop for students to learn robotics. Through his opening remarks, Dr. Md Khalilur Rhaman, Honorable Advisor of IEEE RAS BRACU SBC and professor of CSE at BRAC University, officially opened the workshop.

The workshop's prime aim was to introduce curious students to robotics by introducing development boards, basic programming, and electronics components. The educators have introduced the Robotics Operating System (ROS), a handy tool in robotics.

          <h4>Basic Arduino Boards Workshop at Pabna Zilla School</h4>
          <p class="text-justify">The Dr. Fazle Rabbi Science Club hosted a workshop on "The Basics of Arduino Boards'' on September 5th, 2021, at Pabna Zilla School. The workshop's key speaker was Md Hashibul Islam, Chair of IEEE RAS BRACU SBC and Sub-Team Lead of Network and Vision, BRACU Mongol-Tori. The speakers in this workshop taught the young audience simple programming logic and fun when creating projects. They have designed and demonstrated a few projects on the spot. Following that, there was a concept and skill exchange session, during which the participants learned about various project ideas, study methods for project planning, and firsthand knowledge of how to get into robotics.

Owing to a lack of exposure in this field, people outside of Dhaka are marginally behind. As a representative of Bangladeshi robotics on international forums, it has always been a concern for Team Mongol-Tori to spread robotics awareness in places where children grow up with much enthusiasm but little direction. When Team Mongol-Tori has a chance like this, they take full advantage of spreading the knowledge. Each of these promising prospects is a small step toward developing a generation of enthusiastic robotics inventors.
